          # Target Branch to commit to
          # Only commits to the default branch are considered as contributions.

          # Optional, default is 5
          max-commits: 5


          # Defines exact number of commits to make, useful when you
          # want to make a specific number of commits or use your own random number generator.

          # If you need to ignore push, set this to false.
